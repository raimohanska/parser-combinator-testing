# Parser combinator testing

Just fooling around with Megaparsec. You'll need Stack to run this. Try `brew install haskell-stack`.

Build and run tests in watch mode

    stack build --file-watch --test

build and run the useless executable

    stack build --file-watch --exec ubuntu-combinators-exe
